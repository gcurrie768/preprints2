Begin your workshop with an introduction to the concept of preprints, along with potential benefits and drawbacks.

Poll- Has anyone used preprints before?
Can we define pre-prints (online notepad)

## What are preprints?

Give an introduction to what preprints are. It can be useful to add a discussion element to your workshop to gauge participants' understanding of preprints. You might consider briefly explaining why current academic publishing workflows can often be slow and expensive.

A preprint is an early version of a scholarly article that has not necessarily undergone peer review. Updated versions of a preprint can include changes made by the author and that may have resulted from open or closed commenting, i.e. during the revision process. 

The preprint can be the same as the version of the work submitted to a journal. A preprint may not end up being submitted to a journal for publication. 

A preprint server is an online service that allows authors to upload, describe and disseminate preprints. Most disseminate works as freely available open access (OA) files with no barriers to access. 

The servers commonly do not charge fees to either authors or readers for using their service. They may be supported by an institution and/or the user community, but there are examples of servers owned and operated by commercial companies. Give an introduction to what preprints are.

## Benefits of preprinting

Introduce some of the benefits of preprinting. These could include:

Ask learners to suggest some benefits?

- Benefits for science, e.g. getting your work out there as soon as it’s ready, to reduce delays in knowledge sharing
- Benefits for researchers, e.g. as a free way to publish open access
- •	High visibility through OA can increase readership and citation, although authors should  be  mindful  of  potential  non-expert  interpretations  of  their  pre-review  findings (e.g., in medical disciplines).
•	Preprinting  establishes  the priority  of  new  ideaswith  publicly  time  stamped certification  and  registration. Rapid  dissemination andtimely  sharing of research findings  address  the  problem  of  delay  between  submission  and  publication.  It  is increasingly  common  for  a  preprint repository to be the ‘go to’ location to discover new research.
•	Preprints on some servers are open to comments and feedbackwhich can assist the author  in improving  their  manuscriptand  may  lead  to collaborations.  It  is  often possible to track the versionsof a manuscript because the server retains previous versions.  Some  servers  (e.g.,  PeerJ)  use  preprints  for  comments  and/or  open  peer review.
•	Most journals will accept manuscripts that have previously been disseminated on (usually  not-for-profit)  preprint  servers  (e.g.,  Royal  Society  of  Chemistry  journals): check    journal    permissions    using SHERPA/RoMEO.    Some    preprint    servers automatically add a link from the preprint to the published version after publication.
•	Funders encourage the use of pre-prints
•	Can help to reference work that is not yet published/undergoing consideration at a journal e.g. for funding applications


## Acknowledging concerns

Importantly, address the concerns that your participants have. Common concerns (and how to address them) may include:

- The dangers of having non-peer reviewed studies in public view (and how to mitigate that)
- Having multiple versions of a paper out there (and how to link back to the final published version)

You might want to reassure the participants of your workshop that it’s okay to be concerned about these topics, and that your workshop will help them overcome these concerns.
